# Seesaw Simulation Logic (Pure JS)

This project is a technical assignment for the Software Developer role. It simulates a physics-based seesaw using Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on torque mechanics and DOM manipulation without any external libraries.

## 🛠 Features
* **Physics Engine:** Calculates torque (`Weight x Distance`) for both sides.
* **Smart Sensitivity:** The tilt angle is calculated dynamically (`Torque Diff / 100`) to ensure realistic, smooth animation.
* **Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save the simulation state (objects remain after page refresh).
* **Dark Mode UI:** Designed with a professional, contrast-friendly dark theme.
* **Bonus Features:** Includes Pause functionality, visual ruler/grid, and reset options.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Transitions for smooth animations)
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
